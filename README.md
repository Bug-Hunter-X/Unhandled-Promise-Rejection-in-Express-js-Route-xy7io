This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: forgetting to handle promise rejections in asynchronous route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, where an asynchronous operation is performed, but errors are only logged to the console and no response is sent to the client. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version, showcasing proper error handling to ensure reliable responses.
